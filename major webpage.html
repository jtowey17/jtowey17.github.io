<h1> Marketing</h1>
<p> Marketing is the business of promoting and selling products or services. This includes market research, advertising, search engine optimization and even web design. 
I decided to study marketing after I took a sports marketing class in my senior year in highschool. This class opened my eyes to the different possibilities marketing could offer as a career. 
I enjoy doing research into topics and understanding why people behave the way they do or purchase the items they purchase. I feel I would enjoy a career in market research. Marketing also many opportunities to be creative in the space.
I have taken a few creative writing classes and could also see myself pursuing a career in creative departments in a marketing firm creating advertisments for campaigns as well.</p>
