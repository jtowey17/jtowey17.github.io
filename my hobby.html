<h1> Fly Fishing!</h1>
<p> I recently started to teach myself to fly fish just over 2 years ago. Though I am still not very proficient, I enjoy the sport very much. 
I have always enjoyed fishing, but fly fishing is so much more.
It's exciting to hike out into nature with all my gear and a backpack full of snacks and try and find the perfect run to start making casts. 
While in Grand Forks I have been frequenting Turtle River state park. 
There are some nice runs out there and the scenary is quite beautiful. I have no trouble spending an entire day throwing casts and getting hooked in bushes from time to time. 
I would highly recommend anyone to try out the sport.
