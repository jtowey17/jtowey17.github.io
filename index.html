<h1>About Me!</h1>
<ul>
<li>Name - John Towey</li>
<li>Hometown - Edina, Minnesota</li>
<li>Major - Marketing</li> 
</ul> 

<p>I was born in Edina in 1996 to Terry and Rita Towey. 
I am the youngest of 4 children, which means I was able to get away with just about everything growing up. 
My family has had dogs throughout my life, so I am definitely a dog person. Just about everyone in my family attended the University of Nebraska for school, so I decided to end that tradition.
Growing up, I played a lot of hockey which is one of the reasons I decided to come to UND. Perhaps if I had taken a tour of campus in the winter I would have made a different call however.
Also, Penguins are my favorite animal, please enjoy this emperor. </P>
